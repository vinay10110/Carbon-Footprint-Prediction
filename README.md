# Carbon Footprint Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict carbon footprints based on various lifestyle and consumption factors. The model uses LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, to create accurate predictions of individual carbon footprints.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes various features that influence carbon footprint:
- Electricity consumption (kWh per month)
- Natural gas consumption (therms per month)
- Vehicle miles per month
- House area (square feet)
- Water usage (liters per day)
- Diet type
- Recycling habits
- Home insulation quality
- Smart thermostat installation
- Energy-efficient appliances usage
- Household size
- Meat consumption (kg per week)
- Laundry loads per week
- Public transport usage
- Composting habits

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Missing Value Treatment**
   - Filled missing values in categorical variables with mode
   - Replaced missing values in numerical variables with median
   - Cleaned negative values in consumption metrics

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical using label encoding
   - Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
   - Handled outliers and anomalies in consumption data

3. **Data Splitting**
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
   - Maintained random state for reproducibility

## Model Implementation
The project uses two main approaches:

### 1. PyCaret Automated ML
- Utilized PyCaret's automated machine learning capabilities
- Compared various regression models
- Identified best performing algorithms

### 2. LightGBM Model
Implemented a LightGBM regressor with the following parameters:
- Objective: Regression
- Number of estimators: 100
- Learning rate: 0.1
- Number of leaves: 31
- Random state: 42
